- Switch to simple react the client part, use the harmony for the classes part
- Use es6 for the chrome/firefox

Restart the server from : https://github.com/rangle/typescript-react-redux-starter
- Download the stuff
- Make it run with 2 clients (one from the example, one for the current one)
- Make the server run with ts, having a tsc watching/compiling for it
- Move Chrome here
- Create a build for chrome
- Move firefox here
- Create a build for Firefox
- We should have only one package.json file
- Create the Dockerfile where everything is imported and build

- at each step, create the right launch (we can create a bash file for simplicity)

- Have it on amazon (automatic deploy and everything)
- https everywhere (avoid problem when loading pages)


=========== Future ===========
- Grouping everything inside one project instead of multiples servers
- Using the stores instead of manual 
- User system (login/logout/website with infos/etc...)
- Having a better ui for the comments - inside
- Having a less intrusive comment iframe (transparent, movable => post message)
- Using websocket instead of pool
- Modifiable/deletable comment
- Filter on the server side if a website is commentable
- Test to see if the site has already comments
